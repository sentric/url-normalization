## url-normalization

URL normalization (or URL canonicalization) in general is the process by which URLs are modified and standardized in a consistent manner. The goal of the normalization process is to transform a URL into a normalized or canonical URL so it is possible to determine if two syntactically different URLs may be equivalent. For more detail see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_normalization

Rather than providing several traditional types of normalization for SEO purpose this java libraries provides transforming URLs into comparable and therefore sortable URLs. You can use this code whenever a URL is used as (primary) key in your application or storage system. This library produces URL by inverting the domain level labels by default, but also gives the option not to.

## Normalization process


# Normalizations that Preserve Semantics

 * <b>Converting the host (and scheme) to lower case:</b>
 The host (and scheme)  components of the URL are case-insensitive. This normalizer will convert them to lowercase.
       Example: HTTP://www.Example.com/seARch → com.example/search

 * <b>Decoding percent-encoded octets of unreserved characters:</b>
 For consistency, percent-encoded octets in the ranges of ALPHA (%41–%5A and %61–%7A), DIGIT (%30–%39), hyphen (%2D), period (%2E), underscore (%5F), or tilde (%7E) should not be created by URI producers and, when found in a URI, they will be decoded to their corresponding unreserved characters by this normalizer.
       Example: http://www.example.com/%7Eusername/ → com.example/~username/

 * <b>Removing the default port:</b>
 The default port (port 80 for the “http” scheme) is removed from a URL. 
       Example: http://www.example.com:80/bar.html → com.example/bar.html


# Normalizations that Change Semantics

 * <b>Removing “www” as the first domain label:</b>
 Some websites operate in two Internet domains: one whose least significant label is “www” and another whose name is the result of omitting the least significant label from the name of the first. For example, http://example.com/ and http://www.example.com/ may access the same website. Many websites redirect the user from the www to the non-www address or vice versa. This normalizer determines one of these URLs redirects to the other and normalize all URLs by removing the “www” first level domain.
       Example: http://www.example.com/search → com.example/search
 * <b>Sorting the query parameters:</b>
 Some web pages use more than one query parameter in the URL. This normalizer can sort the parameters into alphabetical order (with their values), and reassemble the URL. 
       Example: http://www.example.com/display?lang=en&article=fred → com.example/display?article=fred&lang=en
 * <b>Removing the "?" when the query is empty:</b>
 When the query is empty, there may be no need for the "?". 
       Example: http://www.example.com/display? → com.example.com/display
